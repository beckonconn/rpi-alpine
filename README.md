# rpi-alpine
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beckonconn/rpi-alpine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beckonocnn/rpi-alpine)

Forked from the Hypriot guys to update the alpine linux version and qemu-arm-static. Go give them a follow and support the work they're doing for bringing docker to RPi. Wouldn't have my container lab without them.

Build an Alpine Docker image for ARM with the `qemu-arm-static` binary.
You are able to run this Docker image in Docker for Mac/Windows.
The Docker image is based on `armhf/alpine`.
